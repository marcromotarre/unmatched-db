    "One of the [design contest](https://restorationgames.com/unmatched-design-contest/) winners, by Adil M. Geresu.\r\n\r\nFrom the Restoration [Twitter](https://twitter.com/restorationgame/status/1369709951887814664):\r\n\r\n> When we saw a deck for the Genie of the Lamp, we were concerned about power level. I mean, the Genie can literally do anything. That's the genius of Adil's design. He didn't shy away from the power - he leaned into it. The power is the flaw. It's genie-ous.\r\n> As the Genie of the Lamp, you'll find yourself with a wealth of options: extra cards, extra actions, extra everything. You'll throw big attacks and put up big defenses. You'll wonder how you could possibly lose....\r\n> \r\n> Until you realize the price of power always catches up with you.",
